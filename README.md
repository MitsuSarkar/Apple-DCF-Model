# 📊 Apple – Integrated 3-Statement Financial Model & DCF Valuation
## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a full financial analyst–style valuation model built in Excel for a large-cap public company (Apple).

The objective was not to predict the stock price, but to understand how financial statements connect, how cash is generated, and how valuation is driven by assumptions.

The model follows a clean, professional structure used in equity research and corporate finance roles.

## 🎯 What This Project Does

Builds a fully integrated 3-statement financial model

Forecasts financial performance over 5 years

Converts accounting profits into Free Cash Flow

Values the business using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach

Tests valuation sensitivity across WACC and terminal growth

Presents Bull / Base / Bear case valuation scenarios

## 🧩 Model Structure

The Excel model is organised into the following tabs:

Assumptions

Revenue growth

Margins

Tax rate

Capex, depreciation, and working capital as % of revenue

Valuation inputs (WACC & terminal growth)

Income Statement

5-year forecast driven entirely by assumptions

Revenue → EBIT → Net Income

Supporting Schedules

Depreciation

Capital expenditure

Working capital and change in working capital

Cash Flow Statement

Cash flow from operations

Cash flow from investing

Net change in cash (fully linked)

Balance Sheet

Cash and PP&E roll-forward

Debt and equity

Balance sheet reconciles each year

DCF Valuation

Free Cash Flow calculation

Discounted cash flows

Terminal value

Enterprise value → Equity value → Implied share price

Sensitivity Analysis

WACC × Terminal growth valuation grid

Bull / Base / Bear case scenarios

## 🧠 Key Learnings

A DCF is more about business logic than Excel formulas

Small changes in assumptions (especially WACC) have a large impact on valuation

Valuation is a range, not a single number

Understanding how profits turn into cash is critical for real-world analysis

Clean structure and transparency matter more than complexity

## 📊 Data Sources

Apple historical financials (10-K / Yahoo Finance)

Simplified assumptions used for learning purposes

## ⚠️ Notes & Limitations

Simplified balance sheet

No share buybacks or dividends modeled

No scenario-specific operating assumptions

These choices were made to keep the model clean, explainable, and interview-ready.

##🛠 Tools Used

Microsoft Excel (no macros, no VBA)

Assumption-driven modeling

Formula-based sensitivity analysis

## 👋 Final Thoughts

This project helped me think like a financial analyst, not just build a spreadsheet.
It strengthened my understanding of financial statement linkages, cash flow drivers, and valuation mechanics.

Always open to feedback and learning further.
